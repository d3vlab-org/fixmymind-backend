echo "VerifySupabaseToken Middleware Test Scenarios:\n\n";

echo "1. Valid Token with Existing User:\n";
echo "   - Request: GET /api/auth/me with Authorization: Bearer <valid_jwt_token>\n";
echo "   - Expected: 200 OK with user data\n\n";

echo "2. Valid Token with New User:\n";
echo "   - Request: GET /api/auth/me with Authorization: Bearer <valid_jwt_token_for_new_user>\n";
echo "   - Expected: 200 OK with newly created user data\n";
echo "   - Side effect: New user created in database\n\n";

echo "3. Invalid Token:\n";
echo "   - Request: GET /api/auth/me with Authorization: Bearer <invalid_token>\n";
echo "   - Expected: 401 Unauthorized with error message\n\n";

echo "4. Missing Token:\n";
echo "   - Request: GET /api/auth/me without Authorization header\n";
echo "   - Expected: 401 Unauthorized\n\n";

echo "5. Malformed Authorization Header:\n";
echo "   - Request: GET /api/auth/me with Authorization: <token_without_bearer>\n";
echo "   - Expected: 401 Unauthorized\n\n";

echo "Configuration Required:\n";
echo "- Add SUPABASE_URL to your .env file\n";
echo "- Example: SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co\n\n";

echo "Middleware Features Implemented:\n";
echo "✓ Extracts Bearer token from Authorization header\n";
echo "✓ Verifies JWT token using Supabase JWK endpoint\n";
echo "✓ Looks up user by supabase_uid\n";
echo "✓ Creates new user if not found (with email and name from token)\n";
echo "✓ Sets authenticated user on request\n";
echo "✓ Returns 401 for invalid/missing tokens\n";
echo "✓ Configurable Supabase URL via environment variable\n";
echo "✓ Robust handling of nested token properties\n";
