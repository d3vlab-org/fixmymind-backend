# Authenticating requests

To authenticate requests, include a **`Authorization`** header with the value **`"Basic {credentials}"`**.

All authenticated endpoints are marked with a `requires authentication` badge in the documentation below.

Use Basic Auth with your credentials (username:password encoded in Base64).
